    <h2><u>Introduction Of Logic Gates</u></h2>
    <p>The Boolean expressions can be graphically represented by using logic circuits.
         These logic circuits can be constructed using solid-state devices called gates, 
         which are capable of switching voltage levels. If x and y are variables,
         then the basic expressions x ∧ y (AND), x ∨ y (OR) and x' (NOT).
    </p><br>
         <h2><u>History and Development</u></h2>
   <p>
       The binary number system was refined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (published in 1705), influenced by the ancient I Ching's binary system. Leibniz established that using the binary system combined the principles of arithmetic and logic.
       In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits.<br>
       Early electro-mechanical computers were constructed from switches and relay logic rather than the later innovations of vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) or transistors (from which later electronic computers were constructed). 
       Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part of the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics,<br>
       for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924.
       Konrad Zuse designed and built electromechanical logic gates for his computer Z1 (from 1935 to 1938).
       From 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima, Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov introduced switching circuit theory in a series of papers showing that two-valued Boolean algebra, which they discovered independently, can describe the operation of switching circuits.<br>
       Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Switching circuit theory became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II,
       with theoretical rigor superseding the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously.
       Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) devices in the forms of PMOS and NMOS were demonstrated by Bell Labs engineers Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng in 1960. Both types were later combined and adapted into complementary MOS (CMOS) logic by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963<br>.
       Active research is taking place in molecular logic gates.

   <h2><u>What is Logic Gate?</u></h2>
   <p>
       A logic gate is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits. They perform <br>
       basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. Most electronic devices we use today will have some form of logic gates <br>
       in them. For example, logic gates can be used in technologies such as smartphones, tablets or within memory devices.<br>
       In a circuit, logic gates will make decisions based on a combination of digital signals coming from its inputs. Most logic gates have two inputs and one output. <br>
       Logic gates are based on Boolean algebra. At any given moment, every terminal is in one of
        the two binary conditions, false or true. False represents 0, and true represents 1.<br>
         Depending on the type of logic gate being used and the combination of inputs, <br>
       the binary output will differ. A logic gate can be thought of like a light switch, wherein one position the output is off -- 0, and in another,<br>
        it is on -- 1. Logic gates are commonly used in integrated circuits (IC)
       </p>

   <h2><u>Symbols</u></h2>
   <p>
    There are two sets of symbols for elementary logic gates in common use, both defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 and its supplement ANSI/IEEE Std 91a-1991.
    The "distinctive shape" set, based on traditional schematics,<br>
    is used for simple drawings and derives from United States Military Standard MIL-STD-806 of the 1950s and 1960s.
    It is sometimes unofficially described as "military", reflecting its origin. The "rectangular shape" set, based on ANSI Y32.<br>
    and other early industry standards as later refined by IEEE and IEC, has rectangular outlines for all types of gate and allows representation of a much wider range of devices than is possible with the traditional symbols.
    The IEC standard, IEC 60617-12, has been adopted by other standards, such as EN 60617-12:1999 in Europe, BS EN 60617-12:1999 in the United Kingdom, and DIN EN 60617-12:1998 in Germany.<br>
    The mutual goal of IEEE Std 91-1984 and IEC 617-12 was to provide a uniform method of describing the complex logic functions of digital circuits with schematic symbols.
    These functions were more complex than simple AND and OR gates. They could be medium scale circuits such as a 4-bit counter to a large scale circuit such as a microprocessor.<br>
    IEC 617-12 and its renumbered successor IEC 60617-12 do not explicitly show the "distinctive shape" symbols, but do not prohibit them. These are, however, 
    shown in ANSI/IEEE Std 91 (and 91a) with this note: "The distinctive-shape symbol is, according to IEC Publication 617, Part 12, not preferred, but is not considered to be in contradiction to that standard." 
    IEC 60617-12 correspondingly contains the note "Although non-preferred, the use of other symbols recognized by official national standards, that is distinctive shapes in place of symbols [list of basic gates],<br>
    shall not be considered to be in contradiction with this standard. Usage of these other symbols in combination to form complex symbols (for example, use as embedded symbols) is discouraged.
    " This compromise was reached between the respective IEEE and IEC working groups to permit the IEEE and IEC standards to be in mutual compliance with one another.<br>
    In the 1980s, schematics were the predominant method to design both circuit boards and custom ICs known as gate arrays. Today custom ICs and the field-programmable gate array are typically designed with Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.
